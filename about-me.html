            <p>I am Daniel Costa (DAC)</p>
            <p>I’m a 29-year-old photographer and designer with a passion for capturing the world as I see it. I love going out with my camera—exploring the streets, nature, architecture—and turning everyday moments into visual stories.

            <p class="quote uppercase center"><span class="colorful-letter">This is important</span> Do what you love, and do it again</p>
            <p>For me, photography is about more than just taking pictures. It’s about feeling something, seeing beauty in the ordinary, and expressing what words can’t always say. Whether it’s the quiet of a forest or the lines of a building, I try to freeze moments that speak for themselves.</p>

            <h2 class="main-title-large center">How it all started...</h2>
            <p>It all began when I was 16. My parents gave me a camera, and from the moment I held it, something clicked—literally and creatively. 
                I started taking photos of everything around me, just exploring the world through a new lens. What began as curiosity quickly turned into a passion.</p>
            <p class="italic">Design</p>
            <p>Over time, I realized photography wasn't just a hobby it was a way for me to express how I see things, how I feel moments. 
                As I grew, I also got into web design. I loved building things visually, shaping ideas into something people could interact with.
                <br>So I decided to bring those two passions together: photography and web design. Now, I not only capture images—I create the spaces where they live. My work is a mix of what I see and how I choose to share it with the world.
